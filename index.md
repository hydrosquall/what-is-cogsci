##Text (mostly disconnected excerpts):

What’s the point of learning? In most subjects, you’re trying to solve problems: 
  
- Biology tries to learn about how living things work, so that we can solve problems like “disease” and “crop failure”. 
- Sociology tries to learn about how... 
- (Continue in this vein) 
  

###What’s the point of practical education?

We’d say something like: “To predict the future”. After all, we can’t solve problems unless we have some idea what will happen if we take a particular course of action.

Most college majors prepare students to predict certain types of futures:

- Biologists try to predict what will happen if we alter the genes of a mouse 

- Engineers try to predict what will happen if we shoot a rocket into space 
- Economists try to predict what will happen if we raise the minimum wage  
  

And so on. There are millions of questions to be answered in the world, and every one has a branch of study behind it.

(Move on to cognitive science example)

(Something about how college prepares you to live in the real world)

In the real world, most people spend most of their time working with other people.

Doctors work with patients. Lawyers work with clients. Salespeople work with potential customers.

We also work with groups of people. Consultants work with businesses, which are made up of people. Traders work with markets, which are made up of even more people. Teachers work with classrooms full of students. Politicians work with districts full of voters.

Some of us work with things that think and solve problems, but aren’t quite people. Roboticists work with computers housed in mechanical bodies. Animal trainers work with lions and tigers and bears.

Oh my! How can we make sense of it all?

Traditionally, the “study of other people” is known as “psychology”. But we also study groups of people and call that “economics” or “sociology”. When we’re studying a mind made of silicon instead of carbon, we call it “artificial intelligence research”. When we study the way minds communicate with other minds, we call it “linguistics”. When we study the way people reason through moral dilemmas or form religious beliefs, another discipline creeps in: “philosophy”.

These areas of study all have something in common: They deal with minds. 

Minds are tricky: Unlike most physical objects, we can’t predict what they’ll do next: Two minds might react very differently to the same stimulus, but two bricks will not.

And unlike books or paintings, minds can be studied in a way that brings us definite information: By studying the behavior of a certain mind, we can learn to predict what it will do next, giving us the chance to create good outcomes.

##What does cognitive science have to do with all this?

Cognitive science is the study of minds. As we’ve seen above, this tends to get split up between lots of different academic subjects in sort of an arbitrary way. Where does “psychology” end and “linguistics” begin? How far can a person deviate from economic models of rationality before we have to predict their next actions with psychology? How similar are the minds of chimpanzees and humans? What about humans and computers?

If someone studies cognitive science, they’re learning to use several of these disciplines at once, so that they can get a better, fuller understanding of the way minds work.

This is getting pretty abstract, so we’ll give you an example:

##FAQs

###Cognitive science didn’t exist in high school, and suddenly it’s a college major- where did it come from? 
    - So academic subjects are sort of complicated 
    - The groupings we have are kind of arbitrary 
    - The point of studying a scientific subject in college is to figure out how to answer questions 
    - Like: How can we design computers that think like humans? 
    - Or: Why do some marketing campaigns work better than others? (What is going on in someone’s head when they watch an advertisement?) 
    - Or: How can we diagnose mental illness earlier and with more accuracy? 
    - Or: What’s the fastest, most effective way to learn (insert subjects here)? 
    - These are all within the domain of cognitive science! 

###Isn’t it just psychology?  
  
Some cognitive science majors focus mostly on psychology. Others are economists, linguists, philosophers, or computer scientists. What we all have in common: We don’t just study one thing, in the traditional academic sense. Instead, we try to use the best tools of many different disciplines to answer some of the world’s most complicated problems.

###What do cognitive scientists DO? 
  
Too many things to list! The best way to find out is to talk to the cognitive scientists you know: You’ll hear some interesting stories.

What’s that? You wanted a real answer? Well, here are some profiles of cognitive scientists -- students, professors, and people who work in many different industries.

###What’s the point of cognitive science? Why not study something real, like engineering or programming?

Look around you. If you’re reading this indoors, everything you see was made by engineers and programmers and electricians and architects and other people who work with stuff.

Look inside yourself. You’re reading this website with your brain. You use your brain 16 hours a day -- more, if you count sleep. You’d think that, after trillions of collective years of using our brains, humans would know pretty much everything about them. 

But we don’t. In fact, we know much less about our brains than we do computers, or bricks. Among the things we don’t know:

- How can we stop procrastinating? And why is it that none of the “foolproof tricks” to stop procrastination actually work 100% of the time? (One of the better articles on procrastination [here](http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/03/procrastination-matrix.html))
- How can we change our own minds? Humans are very bad at updating their beliefs when they encounter new evidence, and this leads to lots of problems. Why is it so hard to actually act on new information, and what techniques will help us do a better job of it? 
- How can we break bad habits? 
- How can we stop crime? 
- How can we persuade other people? 
- How can we stop ourselves from being tricked into believing something false? (Marketing/advertising/gambling/etc.) 
- How can we give someone information in a way that will make them understand? (UX design, effective writing -- you won’t find this in an English department) 

Trouble: Maybe people with a math/science mindset will think that these aren’t “real” problems like a collapsing bridge

##Does cognitive science give you superpowers? (reword) (“what are cognitive scientists good at?”) (“how can you change yourself by studying cognitive science?”) (“What have all cognitive scientists learned?”)

We’re so glad you asked? (“once you know how your brain works, you can do cool things with it”) (your brain, and the brains of others)


####CBT

####Cognitive enhancement (see the word “cognitive”? It can go to some cool places!)

Examples

####Mental Models

(working with ideas from many different fields to build useful metaphors and systems of problem-solving) (Warren Buffet, Random Walk Down Wall Street, Terry Odean, Charlie Munger)
